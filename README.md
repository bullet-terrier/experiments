experimental repository (this thing is going to be a massive mess)

this repository is dedicated to various experiments in various languages to simply provide datapoints and mechanisms that may prove
to be useful, or not.

All code found under this repository is under the paired GNU AGPL V 3.0 unless otherwise specified.

Should you find something useful within this repository that you wish to use, please be certain to include a copy of the license and

Source will be broken up into columnar structures that will idyllically contain any dependency that experiment has, however that is 
not required....
