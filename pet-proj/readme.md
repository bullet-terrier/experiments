goal here- build up a data structure that will be capable of hosting and 
manipulating data from a few nodes.
not sure what I'll need to train it to do, but we'll find out.

for the inception of this project - I'm going to dump some of the data into one of the subdirectories as the test - then
we'll start building up from that.
