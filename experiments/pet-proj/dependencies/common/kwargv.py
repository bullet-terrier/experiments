"""
This is ready for integration into the "COMMON"
library. 

I'm not sure why there are two instances of reconcile - I'm going to need
to look into that.

We'll add a new function args2kwargs (probably too ambiguous)
that will look for "x=y" vs "x x x x x x x x=y x=y" and can 
take additional symbold to look for to split the values.
...

planned changes to the mechanism for parsing lists - looking to using map()
to iterate over longer sets - should allow for faster/better integration
of mini utilities.
